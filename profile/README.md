# GOV.UK Vue

GOV.UK Vue is a project to implement [GOV.UK](https://gov.uk/)-style components in Vue 3.

[govuk-vue](https://github.com/govuk-vue/govuk-vue) implements every [GOV.UK Frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend) component in Vue.

In the future, other components may be added which extend the options available in GOV.UK Frontend, but these will be in a separate project.

GOV.UK Vue is developed by [Matt Eason](https://github.com/matteason). I am not affiliated with GDS and GOV.UK Vue is not an official GOV.UK resource.
